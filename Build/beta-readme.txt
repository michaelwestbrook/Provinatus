Currently working on V2 of Provinatus. This is a safespace for me to test my changes. Please do not to hestitate to tell me anything that is buggy or missing. I appreciate any feedback I can get.
This is an early release. To run this beta version please make sure to manually uninstall the stable version of [URL="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1943-Provinatus.html"]Provinatus[/URL] and associated SavedVars
