Currently working on V2 of Provinatus. This is a safespace for me to test my changes. Please do not to hestitate to tell me anything that is buggy or missing. I appreciate any feedback I can get.
[COLOR="Magenta"]This is an early release. To run this beta version please make sure to manually uninstall the stable version of [URL="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1943-Provinatus.html"]Provinatus[/URL] and associated SavedVars[/COLOR]

What's new
[LIST]
[*]Doing a lot of work on the build/release pipeline. High potential for new bugs. Please report any irregularities.
[*]Waypoint no longer shows by default. You need to explicitly enable it in the menu.
[*]Waypoint now has an enable/disable checkbox and respects size and opacity settings.
[*]Moved most addon config data into the addon source code.

Lot's of shiny icons in the menu :)
